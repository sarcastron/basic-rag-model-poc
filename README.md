# Ariel LLM

This is a prototype of an AI Assistant powered by a Retrieval augmented generation. The model will be prompted with embeddings from [Prospero's learn site](https://learn.prospero.ai) and from [prospero.ai](https://prospero.ai) to generate the responses.

##  Requirements
- Python >=3.11
- [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
- ChromaDB []

## Steps to build prototype

* [] Scrape data from websites and store in text files
* [] Generate Embeddings for the text files
* [] Store the embeddings in a vector database
* [] Basic input UI (CLI) for querying the database
* [] Query the database to get the most similar embeddings
* [] Implement LangChain to query the model
* [] Implement the agent to generate responses
* [] Show the response to the user
